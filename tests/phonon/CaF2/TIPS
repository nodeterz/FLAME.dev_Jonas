1. In the new version of phonopy you must change the following keywords in get_force.py script:
atoms -----> points
position --> coordinates

2. Command for converting unit cell to primitive cell:
  phonopy --symmetry --tol=0.01      (default value for tolerance is 1.d-5)

3. You can set  BAND_CONNECTION = .TRUE. in band.conf. 
With this option, band connections are estimated from eigenvectors and band structure is drawn considering band crossings. 
In sensitive cases, to obtain better band connections, it requires to increase number of points calculated in band segments by the BAND_POINTS tag.
